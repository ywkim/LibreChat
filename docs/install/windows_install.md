## Setup and Run LibreChat
Using the command line (in the root directory)
### To setup the app:
1. Run `npm ci` (this step will also create the env file)
2. Run `npm run frontend`

### To use the app:
1. Run `npm run backend`
2. Run `meilisearch --master-key <meilisearch_Master_Key>` (Only if SEARCH=TRUE)
3. Visit http://localhost:3080 (default port) & enjoy

### Using a batch file

- **Make a batch file to automate the starting process**
  - Open a text editor
  - Paste the following code in a new document
  - The meilisearch executable needs to be at the root of the LibreChat directory
  - Put your MeiliSearch master key instead of "`<meilisearch_Master_Key>`"
  - Save the file as "C:/LibreChat/LibreChat.bat"
  - you can make a shortcut of this batch file and put it anywhere

  ```bat title="LibreChat.bat"
  start "MeiliSearch" cmd /k "meilisearch --master-key <meilisearch_Master_Key>

  start "LibreChat" cmd /k "npm run backend"

  REM this batch file goes at the root of the LibreChat directory (C:/LibreChat/)
  ```
