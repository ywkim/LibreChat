# The server will listen to localhost:3080 by default. You can change the target IP as you want. 
# If you want to make this server available externally, for example to share the server with others 
# or expose this from a Docker container, set host to 0.0.0.0 or your external IP interface. 
# Tips: Setting host to 0.0.0.0 means listening on all interfaces. It's not a real IP.  
# Use localhost:port rather than 0.0.0.0:port to access the server. 
# Set Node env to development if running in dev mode.
HOST=localhost
PORT=3080
